## WHOTS-18 Cruise: WHOTS-18 Mooring Deployment

The Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Upper Ocean Processes Group (WHOI/UOP)
, with the UH group's assistance, conducted the 18 deployment of the WHOTS
mooring on board the Oscar Elton Settle during the WHOTS-18 cruise between July
22 and July 27, 2022. The WHOTS-18 mooring was deployed at Station 52 on July
24, 2022, 02:17 UTC at 22 40.002'N, 157 56.793'W, and the WHOTS-17 mooring were
recovered on July 25, 2022. The scientific personnel that participated during
the cruise are listed in

The UH group conducted shipboard oceanographic observations during the
cruise. A complete description of these operations can be found in
{cite}`Santiago-Mandujano2022`.

A Sea-Bird CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) system was used measure
T, S, and O2 profiles during CTD casts. The time, location, and maximum CTD
pressure for each profile are listed in {numref}`table-2`. Nine CTD casts were
conducted during the WHOTS-18 cruise. CTD profile data were collected at
Station 50 (near the WHOTS-17 buoy) and Station 52 (near the WHOTS-18 buoy). A
test cast was conducted at Station 20 offshore of Makaha, HI, to an approximate
depth of 1501 m to test three acoustic releases ( two to be used in the
WHOTS-18 mooring and one backup) were attached to the rosette frame for
function testing. Four CTD yo-yo casts were conducted to obtain profiles for
comparison with subsurface instruments on the WHOTS-18 mooring after
deployment, and four yo-yo casts were performed for comparison with the
WHOTS-17 mooring before recovery. The yo-yo casts were started about 0.25 nm
from the buoys with varying drift during each cast, and consisted of 5 up-down
cycles between near the surface and 203 to 210 m. The first set of T, C and O2
sensors displayed bad data during various casts, apparently due to problems
with the cable termination, but the second sensors set displayed good data.

Between 3 and 4 water samples were taken from all casts, except from Station 52
casts 2, 3 and 4, in which the pylon failed to communicate with the CTD. These
samples were analyzed for salinity at UH and used to calibrate the CTD
conductivity sensors.

Also, continuous ADCP and near-surface thermosalinograph data were obtained
while underway.

The R/V Oscar Elton Settle was equipped with a TRDI Ocean Surveyor 75 kHz ADCP,
set to function in broadband and narrowband configurations. The configuration
information is shown in {numref}`table-3`. The ADCP used input from a SAMOS
gyrometer and Furuno GP 150, a GPS receiver, to establish the ship's heading
and attitude.

Near-surface temperature and salinity data during the WHOTS-18 cruise were
acquired from the thermosalinograph (TSG) system installed on the NOAA Ship
Oscar Sette. The sensors were sampling water from the continuous seawater
system running through the ship, and were comprised of one thermosalinograph
model SBE-21 (SN 3168) and a micro-thermosalinograph 17 model SBE-45 (SN 0290),
both with (internal) temperature and conductivity sensors located in the ship’s
chemistry lab, about 70 m from the hull intake; and an SBE-38 (SN266)
external temperature sensor located at the entrance of the water intake.
All instruments recorded data every second. The water intake is located at the
bow of the ship, forward from the starboard side bow thruster at a depth of 3m.
The system has a flow meter in the chemistry lab, showing a flow rate of
about 1.1 liter/minute during the cruise. Only the SBE-45 has a debubbler.
Salinity water samples were taken every 8 hours from the exhaust in the
Chemistry lab using 0.25 litter glass bottles, measured in the
UH lab and used to correct for any drift in the thermosalinograph conductivities.

## WHOTS-19 Cruise: WHOTS-18 Mooring Recovery

The WHOI/UOP Group conducted the mooring turnaround operations during the
WHOTS-19 cruise between June 15, and June 22, 2023. The WHOTS-19 mooring was
deployed at Station 50 on June 17, 2023, 02:59 UTC at 22 46.002'N, 157
53.768'W, and the WHOTS-18 mooring was recovered on June 19, 2023, 17:49 UTC.
The scientific personnel that participated during the cruise are listed in
{numref}`table-4`.

The UH group conducted the shipboard oceanographic observations during the
cruise. A complete description of these operations is available in the WHOTS-19
cruise report {cite}`Santiago-Mandujano2024`

A Sea-Bird CTD system was used to measure T, S, and O2 profiles during CTD
casts. The time, location, and maximum CTD pressure for each profile are listed
in {numref}`table-5`.

Five CTD casts were conducted during the WHOTS-19 cruise from June 16 through
June 19. CTD profile data were collected at Station 20 (in transit to the WHOTS
mooring) and Station 52 (near the WHOTS-18 buoy). The cast at Station 20 was
~1500 m deep, and three acoustic releases (two to be used in the WHOTS-19
mooring and one backup) were attached to the rosette frame for function
testing. Four CTD yo-yo casts were conducted to obtain profiles for comparison
with subsurface instruments from WHOTS-18 mooring before recovery. The yo-yo
casts started at about 0.25 nm from the buoys with varying drifts during each
cast, and they consisted of 5 updown cycles near the surface and 200 to 215 m.
CTD modulo errors started appearing during casts 3 and 4, indicating problems
in communication between the CTD and the deck box. The number of
modulo errors considerably increased at the start of casts conducted near the
WHOTS-19 mooring, and those casts were aborted. The errors persisted after
re-terminating the CTD wire connection and even after replacing the CTD with
our spare CTD. We suspect the problem was in the CTD wire or the slip-rings. We
were not able to conduct CTD casts near the WHOTS-19 mooring because of this
problem.

Between 2 and 4 water samples were taken from all casts. These samples
were analyzed for salinity at UH and used to calibrate the CTD
conductivity sensors.
