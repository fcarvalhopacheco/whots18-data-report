# Results

During the WHOTS-18 cruise (WHOTS-18 mooring deployment, 24 July 2022), a
high-pressure ridge far north of the Hawaiian Islands maintained a tight enough
pressure gradient down across the region to produce moderate local trades,
increasing by the end of the cruise. There was no measurable precipitation
during the deployment or recovery times. Conditions during the WHOTS-18
deployment were favorable, with light ENE winds during the deployment. There
were clear skies and no precipitation in the region , and small short- period
wind waves.

Currents were nearly 1 kt to the west in the upper 200 m. This westward flow
seemed to be associated with a high sea level north of Station ALOHA. A
combination of internal semidiurnal and diurnal tides, along with near-inertial
oscillations, were noticeable especially in vertical shear.

CTD casts conducted near the WHOTS-18 buoy (Station 52) after deployment
({numref}`figure6.3`, {numref}`figure6.4`, {numref}`figure6.5`) displayed a
subsurface salinity maximum between 60 and 80dbar and a mixed layer 60 to 80
dbar deep.

During the WHOTS-19 cruise (WHOTS-18 mooring recovery, 19 June 2023), , a
high-pressure ridge far north of the Hawaiian Islands maintained a tight enough
pressure gradient down across the region to produce moderate local trades,
increasing by the end of the cruise. There was no measurable precipitation
during the deployment or recovery times. Conditions during the WHOTS-19
deployment on June 16-17 were favorable. There were 15-16 kt winds from the
east during the deployment and a westward current of nearly 0.5 kt
near the surface. There were clear skies and no precipitation in the region
, and there were small short-period wind waves.

Currents were predominantly to the northwest in the upper 200 m. This westward
flow seemed to be associated with a high sea level north of Station ALOHA. A
combination of internal semidiurnal and diurnal tides, along with near-inertial
oscillations, were noticeable, especially in vertical shear.

CTD casts conducted near the WHOTS-18 buoy (Station 52) before recovery
({numref}`figure6.6`, {numref}`figure6.7`, {numref}`figure6.8`) displayed a
subsurface salinity maximum between 130 and 150 dbar and a mixed layer of about
40 dbar deep.

The temperature MicroCAT records during the WHOTS-18 deployment
({numref}`wh18_Temp_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh18_Temp_9_12.png`) show
noticeable seasonal variability in the upper 100 m. A temperature decrease in
October-November 2019 was evident in the instruments below 65 m. The salinity
records ({numref}`wh18_Sali_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh18_Sali_9_12.png`) do
not show an apparent seasonal cycle, but a salinity increase was recorded
during October-November 2019, by the instruments between 40 and 85 m,
coinciding with the temperature decrease. This increase was followed by a
period of low salinity (less than 35 on average above 120 m) throughout
2020-2021, with extreme values (nearly 34.4) above 120 m in November-December
2019, and above 75 m in July-September 2020.

{numref}`w1_18_contTS.png` through {numref}`w1_18_cont_S.png` show contours of
the WHOTS-18 MicroCAT data in context with data from the previous 15
deployments. The seasonal cycle is evident in the temperature record, with
record temperatures (higher than 26°C) in the summer of 2004, and again in
2014, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020. Salinities in the subsurface salinity maximum
were relatively low during the first 6 years of the record, only to increase
drastically after 2008 through 2015, with some lower salinity episodes in
mid-2011 and early 2012. The salinity maximum extended to near the surface in
early 2010, 2011, late2012-early 2013, and February-March 2013. Salinities in
the salinity minimum decreased after 2015, showing low salinities above 100 m
in 2016, 2017, 2018, and reaching record low values (34.4) in July-August 2019
and July-September 2020. When plotted in {math}`\sigma\theta` coordinates
({numref}`w1_18_cont_S.png`), the salinity maximum seems to be centered roughly
between 24 and 24.5 {math}`\sigma\theta`.

Records from the WHOTS-18 MicroCATs ({numref}`plt_w18_aco_all.png`) deployed
near the bottom of the mooring (4713 m) detected temperature and salinity
changes related to episodic ‘cold events’ apparently caused by bottom water
moving between abyssal basins {cite}`Lukas2001`. These events are being
monitored by instruments at the ALOHA Cabled Observatory (ACO) {cite}`Howe2011`
, a deep water observatory located at the bottom of Station ALOHA (about 6
nautical miles north from the WHOTS-18 anchor), since June 2011.
{numref}`plt_w18_aco_all.png` shows temperature and salinity records from
the WHOTS-18 MicroCATs superimposed on the ACO data. The MicroCAT data
agreed with the temperature decrease and the salinity variability
registered by ACO instruments during cold events in January, March and
December 2020, and a minor events in August 2020 and September 2021.


{numref}`WHOTS-18_u_subplot.png` through {numref}`WHOTS-18_w_subplot.png` shows
the time series of the zonal, meridional, and vertical currents recorded with
the moored ADCPs during the WHOTS-18 deployment.
{numref}`wh1_18_adcp_uvw_cont.png` shows the ADCP current components' contours
in context with data from the previous deployments. Despite the gaps in the
data, an apparent variability is seen in the zonal and meridional currents,
apparently caused by passing eddies. There have been periods of intermittent
positive or negative zonal currents on top of this variability, for instance,
during 2007-2008. The contours of the vertical current component show a
transition in the magnitude of the contours near 47 m, indicating that the 300
kHz ADCP located at 126 m moves more vertically than the 600 kHz ADCP located
at 47.5 m.

A comparison between the moored ADCP data and the shipboard ADCP data obtained
during the WHOTS-18 cruise is shown in
{numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour1.png`, and
{numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour2.png`, and a similar comparison during the
WHOTS-19 cruise is shown in {numref}`whots18recover_adcp_contour1.png` and
{numref}`whots18recover_adcp_contour2.png`. Some differences were seen,
especially in the zonal component, maybe due to the mooring motion, which was
not removed from the data. Comparisons between the available shipboard ADCP
from HOT-316 to -332 cruises and the mooring data are shown in
{numref}`wh18_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_300_1.png` through
{numref}`wh18_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_600_2.png`.
```

The Xeos-GPS receiver registered the WHOTS-18 buoy motion, and its positions
are plotted in {numref}`wh18xeos_pos.png`. The buoy remained predominantly
around its intended deployment location, with noticeable variability both in
latitude and longitude, particularly during the periods from November 2022 to
March 2023. The power spectrum of these data {numref}`wh18_adcp_tilt.png`)
shows significant energy at the diurnal (K1) and semidiurnal (M2) tidal
frequencies, indicating that tidal forces were a major driver of the buoy's
movement. Combining the buoy motion with the tilt (a combination of pitch and
roll) from the ADCP data ({numref}`wh18_adcp_tilt.png`) showed that the tilt
increased as the buoy's distance from the anchor increased. This was expected
since the inclination of the cable increases as the buoy moves farther from the
anchor.

## Thermosalinograph Data

Underway measurements of near-surface temperature and salinity from the
thermosalinograph (TSG) system onboard the R/V Oscar Sette cruise are presented
in {numref}`ac41thsl_final.png` and navigational data is shown in
{numref}`ac41nav_final.png` for the WHOTS-18 cruise. The WHOTS-18 underway
seawater system that feeds the TSG failed on October 11, 2019, due to air
going into the plumbing, causing the pumps to stop working during
deteriorated weather conditions. TSG and navigational data during the
WHOTS-19 cruise, onboard the R/V Oscar Sette, are presented in {numref}
`ac42thsl_final.png` and {numref}`ac42nav_final.png`, respectively. The
data between August 25 and 27, 2021 are particularly bad because it was
during transit back to Oahu to disembark a crew member with medical
problems, and the flow through the system was stopped during that time.

were located. The salinities are plotted in {numref}`wh18_Sali_1_4.png`
through {numref}`wh18_Sali_21.png`. The potential densities ({math}`\sigma\theta`) are
plotted in {numref}`wh18_Sigma_1_4.png` through {numref}`wh18_Sigma_21.png`.

Contoured plots of temperature and salinity as a function of depth for the
deployments WHOTS-1 through -16 are presented in {numref}`w1_18_contTS.png`,

## Moored ADCP Data

The contour plots presented in {numref}`wh1_18_adcp_uvw_cont.png` illustrate
the temporal evolution of the smoothed horizontal (zonal and meridional
components) and vertical velocity as a function of depth for the WHOTS mooring
deployments from WHOTS 1 through WHOTS 18. The zonal velocity shows seasonal
variability, with alternating eastward and westward flows often observed down
to 100 meters. Notable changes are evident particularly during the deployments
from 2010 to 2012 and from 2018 to 2020, where shifts in both magnitude and
direction are prominent. The meridional component displays considerable
variability in northward and southward flow, with the most significant changes
occurring between 2011 and 2013. The vertical velocity component remains weaker
overall, but increased variability is noticeable during the 2011 to 2013 period
and again from 2018 onward.

These observations highlight key periods of variability and provide insights
into the evolving current structure throughout the WHOTS deployments. The years
2011-2013 and 2018-2020 stand out as periods with significant changes in both
horizontal and vertical velocity patterns.

The vertical velocity component is relatively weak compared to the horizontal
components, indicating minimal large-scale vertical movement. However, slight
positive and negative velocities during specific periods suggest internal wave
activity or localized vertical mixing events.

The plots in {numref}`wh_18_adcp_uvw_cont.png` detail the WHOTS-18 ADCP
velocity measurements from mid-2022 through early 2023. The zonal velocity
exhibits a predominantly westward flow throughout the deployment, with
occasional eastward anomalies observed in the late summer and early winter
months. These patterns align with seasonal wind forcing and possibly localized
wind-driven upwelling events. The meridional velocity reveals alternating
periods of northward and southward movement, suggesting the influence of
mesoscale eddies and regional circulation patterns that drive variability along
the meridional axis. In particular, significant northward transport was
observed during late 2022, which transitioned to a southward direction in early 2023.

The vertical velocity component is relatively weak compared to the horizontal
components, indicating minimal large-scale vertical movement, consistent with
the stratified nature of the upper ocean at these depths. However, slight
positive and negative velocities during specific periods suggest internal wave
activity or localized vertical mixing events.

These plots collectively help us understand the dynamics of the ocean at the
WHOTS-18 site, highlighting the importance of the combined influence of local
wind forcing, mesoscale eddy activity, and internal waves in shaping the
observed current structure.

A staggered time-series of smoothed horizontal and vertical velocities are
shown in {numref}`WHOTS-18_u_subplot.png` through
{numref}`WHOTS-18_w_subplot.png`. Smoothing was performed by applying a daily
running mean to the data and then interpolating it on an hourly grid.

## Moored and Shipboard ADCP comparisons

The contour plots in {numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour1.png`,
{numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour2.png`,
{numref}`whots18recover_adcp_contour1.png`, and
{numref}`whots18recover_adcp_contour2.png` present a comparison of the zonal
and meridional current components captured by both the shipboard 75 kHz ADCP
from the Oscar Sette and the moored 300 kHz ADCP at the WHOTS-18 mooring site.
These plots provide insights into the consistency and discrepancies between
shipboard and moored ADCP measurements throughout the WHOTS-18 and WHOTS-19
cruises.

### WHOTS-18 Deployment Comparison

For the WHOTS-18 cruise (as shown in {numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour1.png`
and {numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour2.png`), the shipboard ADCP data from
the Oscar Sette and the moored ADCP data reveal certain distinctions between
zonal and meridional velocities at similar depths. Notably, the zonal current
data show consistent eastward and westward oscillations between both ADCPs,
though the magnitude appears more pronounced in the shipboard ADCP,
particularly around late July 2022. These differences may be
influenced by the positioning of the moored ADCP relative to the ship's track
and its response to localized eddies or current variations.

The meridional current comparison (as presented in
{numref}`whots18deploy_adcp_contour2.png`) also displays variations between the
two datasets. The moored ADCP, being positioned at a fixed depth, captures
consistent northward and southward patterns, whereas the shipboard ADCP data
exhibit more fluctuation at shallower depths, potentially linked to local
surface current variability during the cruise. The variability is especially
pronounced around late July 2022, which aligns with the timing of increased
dynamic activity also observed in the zonal component.

### WHOTS-19 Deployment Comparison

During the WHOTS-19 cruise, comparisons of the shipboard ADCP zonal and
meridional currents are shown in {numref}`whots18recover_adcp_contour1.png` and
{numref}`whots18recover_adcp_contour2.png`. The zonal current
reveals a predominantly westward flow throughout the deployment period, with
occasional eastward pulses, particularly around day 168 and day 169. These
eastward flows are concentrated mainly between 40 to 70 meters and appear
prominently at different times during the deployment. By day 170, the flow
returns to a more consistent westward direction across all depths, indicating a
shift back to the dominant current pattern.

The meridional current displays alternating northward and southward flows,
which are more variable compared to the zonal currents. Between day 168 and day
169, there is a transition from predominantly southward flow to mixed northward
and southward patterns, particularly in the upper 70 meters. Below 70 meters,
the variability in meridional flow becomes less pronounced, with smoother
transitions between northward and southward flows.

One important note is that the 300 kHz and the 600 kHz moored ADCP experienced
operational interruptions, and we couldn't make a direct comparison between the
Shipboard ADCP and Moored ADCP data for the WHOTS-19 deployment cruise. The
300 kHz instrument stopped recording on January 24, 2023, and the 600 kHz
instrument stopped on February 10, 2023, likely due to power loss caused by
bulkhead corrosion. As a result, only the shipboard ADCP data is available for
the WHOTS-19 cruise analysis, limiting the ability to cross-verify these
measurements with the moored instruments.

Comparisons between quality-controlled moored ADCPs during the WHOTS-18
deployment and available shipboard ADCP obtained during regular HOT cruises 338
to 342, and during the mooring deployment (WHOTS-18) and recovery (WHOTS-19)
cruises are shown in {numref}`wh18_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_300_1.png` for the 300
kHz ADCP. Median and mean velocity profiles were computed when HOT CTD casts
were being conducted near the WHOTS mooring specifically intended to calibrate
moored instrumentation (see {ref}`/5_section.md#conductivity-calibration`). The
HOT shipboard profiles were taken when the ship was stationary, within 1 km of
the mooring, and within 4 hours before the start and 4 hours after the end of
the CTD cast conducted near the WHOTS mooring.

The HOT cruises conducted on the R/V Kilo Moana from HOT-338 to HOT-342
utilized various acoustic instruments for data collection. The TRDI Ocean
Surveyor 38 kHz (OS38BB) was operated in broadband mode with a 12-meter bin
size and 5-minute ensemble intervals, although data in broadband mode was not
available for HOT-340 and HOT-341. Additionally, the cruises used the TRDI
Ocean Surveyor 38 kHz in narrowband mode (OS38NB), with a 24-meter bin size and
5-minute ensemble. Furthermore, the Teledyne Workhorse 300 kHz, with a 2-meter
bin size and 2-minute ensemble intervals, was employed throughout all the
cruises.

Comparisons between the moored 300 kHz ADCP and the shipboard ADCP were
available from HOT-339 to HOT-342, as shown in
{numref}`wh18_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_300_1.png`. Data from other HOT-338 was
excluded due to a lack of comparable measurements. Comparisons between the
moored 600 kHz ADCP and the shipboard ADCP are presented in
{numref}`wh18_moor_ship_ADCP_comp_600_2.png`.

## Next Generation Vector Measuring Current Meter Data (VMCM)

Time-series of daily mean horizontal velocity components for the VMCM current
meters deployed during WHOTS-18 at 10 m and 30 m depths are presented in
{numref}`whots18vmcm_plot.png`. The plots show the zonal and meridional
velocity components for each depth, highlighting the variability in both
east-west and north-south flows.

At 10 m depth, the zonal speed shows a notable oscillatory pattern, with peaks
reaching up to 0.4 m/s in both eastward and westward directions. The meridional
component at 10 m similarly exhibits variability, with alternating northward
and southward flows, although the magnitude generally remains below 0.4 m/s. At
30 m depth, the zonal and meridional velocities exhibit similar oscillatory
behavior, though the magnitude of the oscillations is slightly reduced compared
to the 10 m depth. The zonal component continues to display alternating
eastward and westward flows, with slightly dampened peaks compared to the
surface. The meridional component also shows consistent fluctuations, with
amplitudes generally below 0.4 m/s, indicating the persistence of dynamic
current structures even at 30 m depth.

## GPS Data

Time-series of latitude and longitude of the WHOTS-18 buoy from GPS data are
presented in {numref}`wh18xeos_pos.png`. The plots illustrate the variability
in the buoy's position over time, from late July 2022 to June 2023, providing
insights into the movement and stability of the buoy during the deployment.

The latitude time-series (upper panel) shows fluctuations around a central
value of approximately 22.66°N, with variations ranging between 22.64°N and
22.68°N. These deviations indicate lateral movement of the buoy, potentially
caused by surface currents, wind forcing, and wave action. Notable peaks in
latitude variability are observed around November 2022 and March 2023,
suggesting periods of increased displacement due to dynamic oceanic or
atmospheric conditions.

The longitude time-series (lower panel) depicts similar variability, with
values fluctuating around 157.95°W, ranging from approximately 157.92°W to
157.98°W. The longitudinal deviations mirror the behavior seen in the latitude
plot, indicating that the buoy experienced both east-west and north-south drift
throughout the deployment. The increased variability in longitude, particularly
around November 2022 and March 2023, aligns with the latitude observations,
suggesting consistent periods of elevated buoy movement.

Spectra of the latitude and longitude time-series from the WHOTS-18 buoy are
presented in {numref}`wh18gps_spec_dpng.png`. These power spectra provide
insights into the dominant frequencies of movement and help identify the
temporal scales of variability affecting the buoy's position.

The power spectrum of the latitude time-series (upper panel) shows a decreasing
trend in energy from low to high frequencies, indicating that most of the
variability in the buoy's latitude occurs over longer timescales. The notable
peaks around the frequencies marked as K1 and M2 suggest the influence of tidal
components. The K1 tidal frequency corresponds to diurnal tidal cycles, while
the M2 frequency is indicative of semidiurnal tides. These features highlight
the impact of tidal forces on the buoy's latitudinal movement.

Similarly, the power spectrum of the longitude time-series (lower panel) also
shows dominant energy at lower frequencies, reflecting the longer-term
variability in the buoy's east-west displacement. Peaks at the K1 and M2
frequencies are also present, suggesting that the buoy's longitudinal movement
is affected by similar tidal components as the latitude. The general trend of
decreasing energy at higher frequencies suggests that high-frequency processes,
such as wind or short-period waves, contribute less to the overall movement
compared to lower-frequency tidal and mesoscale processes.

Overall, the spectral analysis reveals that the buoy's movement is largely
driven by tidal forces, with significant contributions from both diurnal and
semidiurnal components.

## Mooring Motion

The position of the mooring with respect to its anchor was determined from GPS
positions, supplemented by additional information provided by the ADCP data on
pitch, roll, and heading. This section presents an analysis of the mooring's
motion and its relationship to the tilt recorded by the ADCP instruments.

{numref}`wh18_adcp_tilt.png` shows scatter plots of the ADCP tilt (a
combination of pitch and roll) against the buoy's distance from its anchor,
derived from GPS positions, for both the 300 kHz and 600 kHz ADCPs during
WHOTS-18. The red line in each plot represents a quadratic fit to the median
tilt, calculated in 0.2 km distance bins. The plots demonstrate that as the
distance of the buoy from the anchor increased, the tilt of the ADCP also
increased.

This increase in tilt is consistent with the mooring line's deviation from its
vertical position as the anchor pulled on it due to environmental forces such
as currents, wind, and waves. The deviation causes the mooring line to tilt,
which in turn affects the attached instruments, resulting in greater tilting of
the ADCPs as the buoy moves farther from the anchor. This phenomenon highlights
the dynamic interaction between the mooring and its environment, which can
impact the measurements taken by the instruments.

It is also important to note that both the 300 kHz and 600 kHz moored ADCPs
experienced operational interruptions. The 300 kHz instrument stopped recording
on January 24, 2023, and the 600 kHz instrument stopped on February 10, 2023,
likely due to power loss caused by bulkhead corrosion. Despite this, the
scatter plot for both ADCPs still provides valuable insight into the
relationship between tilt and distance before the failure occurred. The
correlation coefficients (R = 0.57 for the 300 kHz ADCP and R = 0.60 for the
600 kHz ADCP) indicate a moderate positive relationship between the distance
from the anchor and the tilt, demonstrating that the farther the buoy drifted,
the more significant the ADCP tilt became.

distance bins.
